## This is a password generator for demonstration purposes

This is not built for commercial use or hacker use.  I developed this freelance project to help technology users to create stronger passwords for user accounts.

Users can generate random passwords from characters with numbers, letters and special characters.  

This is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS:  responsive & scalable.  Deployed via GitHub Actions.
